## Background
#### The New York Citi Bike Program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States. Generating regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
#### Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
#### However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Task
Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report.
